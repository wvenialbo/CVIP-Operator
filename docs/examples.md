# Examples of use

For creating a matrix/image operator, you just create a class implementing the
`:::cpp i_operator_predicate` interface defined in `:::cpp core/i_operator.hpp`,
you even do not need to derive your class from it. In the `:::cpp do_apply`
member function you implement your operation logic or, if it is a complex
algorithm, use that member as the entry point to your algorithm.

!!! hint "Note"

    You do not need to implement the `:::cpp i_operator` nor derive a class
    from `:::cpp base_operator<T>` or `:::cpp basic_operator<T>` template
    classes, unless you want to extend the operator functionality.

In the operator predicate you just created, you may encapsulate any existing
OpenCV method, or implement your own operation algorithm.

## Creating an image transform operator

To illustrate this, let始s define an image color/intensity inverter operator.

First, we define our predicate class:

    :::cpp
    #include <cvip/core/i_operator.hpp>

    class invert_predicate /* : public cvip::core::i_operator_predicate */
    {
    public:

        void do_apply(matrix& dst, matrix& src, bool const first [[maybe_unused]]);

    };

Then we define the `:::cpp invert_predicate::do_apply` method:

    :::cpp
    #include <opencv2/core.hpp>
    #include <cassert>

    void invert_predicate::do_apply(matrix& dst, matrix& src, bool const first [[maybe_unused]])
    {
        assert(not src.empty());

        if (CV_8U <= src.depth() and src.depth() <= CV_32S)
        {
            cv::bitwise_not(src, dst);
        }
        else if (CV_32F <= src.depth() and src.depth() <= CV_16F)
        {
            cv::subtract(mscalar::all(1.0), src, dst);
        }

        src = matrix{ };
    }

And that始s all.

You may have realised that, at termination of `:::cpp invert_predicate::do_apply()`,
I assigned an empty matrix to the `:::cpp src` input variable. This is a
requirement in my projects because in the call to the next operator in a chain
of operators, that value will be passed by reference as the `:::cpp dst`
argument. I designed it this way because, when I am working with a set of
operators that process compatible images, that is, those with the same depth,
size, and number of channels, the value in `:::cpp dst` will be used as the
destination or temporary buffer if it has the appropriate size.

!!! info "Rationale"

    The rationale behind this is that, commonly, an algorithm requires a
    temporary buffer to perform its operation, so, in my predicates, if the
    buffer received in `:::cpp dst` is of the required size or can hold my
    temporary data, it allows me to avoid allocating/deallocating memory for
    each operation in my pipeline. Since I have not allocated any temporary
    for this case, I must clear `:::cpp src` to avoid the next operator
    overwrite the input image.

## Creating a parametric transform operator

Most of the times, an operation needs to be configured through parameters.
`:::cpp basic_operator<T>` supports forwarding of its variadic arguments. Just
define your operator predicate classes with the required overloaded
constructors. Although not an operator, *sensu stricto*, let define an operator
to pad an image with pixels. This kind of operation is commonly needed before
applying convolutional or morphological structuring operators to an image.

Again, we first define our predicate class:

    :::cpp
    #include <cvip/core/i_operator.hpp>

    class padding_predicate /* : public cvip::core::i_operator_predicate */
    {
    public:

        padding_predicate(int const t, int const r, int const b, int const l,
                          mscalar const v = mscalar::all(0)) noexcept;

        void reset(int const t, int const r, int const b, int const l) noexcept;

        void reset(mscalar const v) noexcept;

        void do_apply(matrix& dst, matrix& src, bool const first [[maybe_unused]]);

    private:

        static auto constexpr T = 0;
        static auto constexpr R = 1;
        static auto constexpr B = 2;
        static auto constexpr L = 3;

        int m_border[4] = { 0 };

        mscalar m_value = mscalar{ mscalar::all(0) };

    };

The `:::cpp m_border` member array stores the padding size for the top, right,
bottom, and left sides. The `m_value` member stores the pixel value to
initialize the padding pixels.

    :::cpp
    padding_predicate::padding_predicate(int const t, int const r, int const b, int const l,
                                         mscalar const v) noexcept :
        m_border{ t, r, b, l },
        m_value{ v }
    {
        assert(t >= 0 and r >= 0 and b >= 0 and l >= 0);
    }

The reset member allows us to update the current parameter values of an operator
predicate. It is called from the `:::cpp basic_operator<T>::operator()` member
function.

    :::cpp
    #include <cassert>

    void padding_predicate::reset(int const t, int const r, int const b, int const l) noexcept
    {
        assert(t >= 0 and r >= 0 and b >= 0 and l >= 0);
        m_border[T] = t, m_border[R] = r, m_border[B] = b, m_border[L] = l;
    }

    void padding_predicate::reset(mscalar const v) noexcept
    {
        m_value = v;
    }

Finally, the `:::cpp padding_predicate::do_apply()` just calls the native
implementation provided by OpenCV.

    :::cpp
    #include <opencv2/core.hpp>
    #include <cassert>

    void padding_predicate::do_apply(matrix& dst, matrix& src, bool const first [[maybe_unused]])
    {
        assert(not src.empty());

        cv::copyMakeBorder(src, dst, m_border[T], m_border[B], m_border[L],
                           m_border[R], cv::BORDER_CONSTANT, m_value);

        assert(dst.cols == src.cols + m_border[L] + m_border[R]);
        assert(dst.rows == src.rows + m_border[T] + m_border[B]);

        src = matrix{ };
    }

## What have we gained?

So, what have we gained by creating all these predicates and operators? Here is
an example of code that will load an image, invert it and pad it with two black
pixels on each side:

    ::cpp
    #include <cvip/core/operator.hpp>

    // Alias your operators

    using Inv = cvip::core::basic_operator<invert_predicate>;
    using Pad = cvip::core::basic_operator<padding_predicate>;

    // Load your image

    auto im1  = cv::imread("my_dataset/lena.tif", cv::IMREAD_UNCHANGED);

    // Instance and configure your operators

    auto P    = Pad{ 2, 2, 2, 2 };

    // Apply your pipeline

    auto im2  = P * Inv{} * im1;

In the last line, the invert operator is applied as a temporary rvalue. The
equivalent traditional OpenCV code is less elegant:

    ::cpp
    #include <opencv2/core.hpp>

    // Load your image

    auto im1  = cv::imread("my_dataset/lena.tif", cv::IMREAD_UNCHANGED);

    // Apply your pipeline

    auto tmp = cv::Mat{ };

    if (CV_8U <= im1.depth() and im1.depth() <= CV_32S)
    {
        cv::bitwise_not(im1, tmp);
    }
    else if (CV_32F <= im1.depth() and im1.depth() <= CV_16F)
    {
        cv::subtract(mscalar::all(1.0), im1, tmp);
    }

    auto im2 = cv::Mat{ };

    cv::copyMakeBorder(tmp, im2, 2, 2, 2, 2, cv::BORDER_CONSTANT, cv::Scalar::all(0));

Moreover, the program flux is obscure, it is not that evident from reading the
code what action is executing in each line.

We始ve gained simplicity while preserving efficiency, expressions and operators
are lightweight opaque proxy objects and predicates are lightweight objects as
well, the overhead added while constructing a pipeline expression is negligible.

!!! note "Remark"

    You may find that I aliased the OpenCV matrix class `:::cpp cv::Mat`
    as `:::cpp cvip::matrix` in `cvip/internal/basic_types.hpp`{.file} and
    imported `:::cpp cv::swap` into the `:::cpp ::cvip` namespace in
    `cvip/internal/basic_imports.hpp`{.file}. That始s because I use to map
    this toolset to other matrix libraries. That is, the source code in this
    library is OpenCV agnostic, you can map to any other matrix library just
    replacing the above aliases. Even more, you can replace the matrix type alias
    with any other type for which you need the semantics provided by this toolset.
