!!! Remarks

    The source code file headers mention the name â€˜AsterAID Projectâ€™, that is
    because the code was originally written for an asteroid detection software
    package called that way. Speaking-of, you can follow this amazing [space
    rock][nasa-rock] (or [here][mpc-rock]) as it wanders the Solar System. ðŸ˜‰
