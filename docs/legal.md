## License

This project is licensed under combination of *BSD 3-Clause Clear* and *BSD with
attribution* licenses. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file in the project root for
full license information.

The [*BSD 3-Clause Clear License*][bsd-clear] (`BSD-3-Clause-Clear`{.none}) is
the same as [*BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License*][bsd-clause]
(`BSD-3-Clause`{.none}) but with explicit statement as to no patent rights
granted in last paragraph.

The [*BSD with attribution*][bsd-attrib] license
(`BSD-3-Clause-Attribution`{.none}) is identical to [*BSD 3-Clause "New" or
"Revised" License*][bsd-clause] (`BSD-3-Clause`{.none}), with the exception of
clause 4. Clause 4 adds an “attribution” requirement, not to be confused with
the “advertising” clause found in old (original) BSD-4-Clause license texts. It
is Free, but GPL compatibility is unclear at this time.
